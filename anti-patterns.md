# Scrum anti-patterns

## Velocity as a target

[Goodhart's law][1]

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

Velocity is a useful measure to help us forecast and plan.

- People will fudge the numbers by moving things to done before the sprint is early, and being tempted to "complete" unfinsihed tasks
- People will fudge the numbers by underestimating after a bad sprint, leading to inconsistent measurements

## Team Formation

Scrum team is not self-encapsulated and has too many dependencies keeping it from getting work done.
A scrum team should have as little external dependencies as possible. For example, on QA.

In reality, a team will never be encapsulated and will always have some type of external dependency. The Scrum master should work to reduce these, and step in when there is an ipediment

## Retrospective

This is one of the most import parts of scrum when it comes to being agile; don't skip it!

Beware of being negative vs being positive and focusing on solutions/improvements!

The focus should not be so much on what went wrong, but what went right, and how to make the next spring more enjoyable! No griping, stay positive!

## Hero Developer

Heros almost always ignore quality. We need team players and no heroes.

Heros may not like scrum as scrum is more about the team. Try to encourage to heroe to be part of a high functioning team

## Absent Product Owner

Either there is no product owner, the product owner isn't very available, or the product owner has no authority and acts as a proxy for the one who is making the decisions

# Conclusion

## Don't just highlight anti-patterns, fix them!

1. Assume nothing
2. Ask questions
3. Highlight the truth
